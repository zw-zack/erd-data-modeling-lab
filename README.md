# Practice Database Design

## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes and how they would related to other tables.

Break into pairs and work together to draw out diagrams for one of the apps below. You'll be drawing on the wall, so snap photos of the drawings when you've finished for safe keeping.

Afterwards, we'll ask for volunteers (or pick some participants) to walk us through your thinking & explain your decisions.

Remember to consider all different angles in each of these examples. What jobs relationships exist? What people are there? What objects and intangible ideas are necessary? How would you organize it?

## Exercise

- Pick one or more of the following analyze what it primarily does & try to draw the tables & relationships. Don't try to model every single piece of data within the app. Start with the most important models and add on from there.

  - Facebook
  - 99.co
  - Github
  - Carousell
  - AirBnB
  - Medium
  
  Hint: If you're not sure how to make a given table or store a piece of data, write in, with dummy data, all the columns of a single record / row.

#### Deliverable

An ERD diagram, using crow's foot notation, of whatever app you choose.  For example:


<p align="center">

</p>

> Note: this example has "Items" as placeholders for the attributes.

#### Deliverable 2
Write the `tables.sql` file for this app. Write a `seed.sql` for the first row or two in every table.
